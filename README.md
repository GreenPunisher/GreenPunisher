I have been interested in the IT security sector for a long time. I admit that I had a bit of a misconception about hacking and didn't delve deeply enough into it. 
I only scratched the surface, if at all. I will change that NOW. This has been going on for about a year and a half now. 
I have not used google for more than a year now. No WhatsApp, no IG, never had FB. No Google account, no Gmail.

My IT knowledge is good. In any case, more than the 0815 everyday user.
However, I lack real knowledge, a clear understanding of how things work and what happens. If I am a script kiddie at all, I want to get rid of this as soon as possible. 

My hardwear consists of:
+ 1x Acer Predator Triton 300 (with Windows 10)
+ 1x Nitrokey Lenovo Thinkpad X230 with i7, 1TB SSD & 16GB RAM (with Qubes, but oh man I crap, its so hard, recently I tried to reinstall it...error,error,error...I will try again)
+ 1x Nitrokey Lenovo Thinkpad T430 witth i7, 1TB SSD & 16GB RAM (with Linux Mint; will be my main operating system.  In general I want to switch to Linux).
+ 1x Samsung Galaxy S5 active (with Costem ROM Lineage OS)
+ (1x Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge; should be my replacement for the S5 active but I fail with the bootloader and adb in general)
+ various external hard drives. (I don't store any personal or other data on my laptops).
+ 1x Iphone 7 Plus (not exactly secure and privacy compliant but I only use it at home for Netflix, CODM and YT. Without sim, only via home network)

I want to learn/my projects:
+ -Complete an apprenticeship in the IT industry and then further my education and establish myself in the IT security field. 
+ -Improve my English. I don't understand it well enough yet. 
+ -Switch to Linux
+ -master the Linux terminal (not only master it, I want to merge with it, become one)
+ -To understand the Linux terminal and to get along with all the available commands I want to learn bash, shell-programming.
+ -Intensify and expand VMware use.
++ VMware Workstation Pro is running on my Acer. Installed in it I have
various Linux systems Mint, Pop_os, debian 11.0.0, pureos, kali-linux and ParrotOS.
To try out and experiment.
+ -Get away from Google. Reduce the use to a minimum. Preferably not at all.
+ -I also want to reduce my use of Windows and Microsoft products to a minimum. GOAL: Everything only with Linux. In between GOAL: A large part on Linux and the rest via Win in a VM.
+ -Improve password management. I simply have too many. E.v. 2FA is an option for me.

Now up to date:
+ - Learning with HTB. Linux Fundamentals etc.


If you want to know more about me or have some homework for me that will help me further my education, go ahead.
